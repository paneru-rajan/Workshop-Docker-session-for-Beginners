## Docker

![Docker](assets/docker_def.jpg)
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your
applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your
infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for
shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running
it in production.

Why

1. Fast, consistent delivery of your applications
2. Responsive deployment and scaling
3. Running more workloads on the same hardware
